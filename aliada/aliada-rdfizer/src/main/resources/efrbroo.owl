This property associates a publication, i.e. an instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type, with an instance of E55 Type, which all exemplars of that publication should belong to, as long as they are recognised as exemplars of that publication. Typically, this property is observed on one exemplar of a publication, and extrapolated to all other exemplars of the same publication. This logical inference is an induction along the path that can be modelled as: F3 Manifestation Product Type R7B has example F5 Item P41B was classified by E17 Type Assignment P42 assigned E55 Type.

It can happen that a given exemplar, or subset of exemplars, originally produced, or intended to be produced, with that characteristic, accidentally lacks it. This fact should be recorded as a property of F5 Item, and not of F3 Manifestation Product Type.

This property associates an instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression with an instance of F2 Expression that was included in it and that is a realisation of an independent work. The incorporated expression may be self-contained or fragmentary.

This property makes it possible to recognise the autonomous status of the incorporated expression, which was created in a distinct context, and can be incorporated in many distinct self-contained expressions, and to highlight the difference between structural and accidental whole-part relationships between conceptual entities.

It accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc.

Examples:
The text of the present version of the FRBROO definition (F22) R14 incorporates The beginning of the Scope Note for E4 Period in the CIDOC CRM definition, version 4.4 (F23)

The text of the anthology entitled ‘American Women Poets of the Nineteenth Century: An Anthology’, edited by Cheryl Walker and published by Rutgers University Press in July 1992 (F22) R14 incorporates The text of the poem entitled ‘Acquainted with Grief’ and authored by Helen Hunt Jackson

The sonic content of the CD entitled ‘Great moments of Lucia Popp’ issued by EMI Music International in 1996 and identified by UPC/EAN ‘0724356577022’ (F24) R14 incorporates The recorded performance of Mozart’s aria entitled ‘Der Hölle Rache’ (also known as ‘The Queen of the Night’s Aria’) by Lucia Popp accompanied by the Philharmonia orchestra conducted by Otto Klemperer in London, Kingsway Hall, between March 24, 1964 and April 10, 1964 (F26)

The set of instructions for the production of ‘King Lear’, directed by Sergei Radlov in Moscow in 1935 (F25) R14 incorporates The Yiddish text of ‘King Lear’ as translated by Shmuel Galkin (F22)

The set of instructions for the production of ‘King Lear’, directed by Sergei Radlov in Moscow in 1935 (F25) R14 incorporates the musical content of the score of the incidental music composed by Lev Pulver (F22)

The set of instructions for the production of ‘King Lear’, directed by Sergei Radlov in Moscow in 1935 (F25) R14 incorporates The visual items (E36) shown in Alexander Tyschler’s scene settings and the models built by him for these settings (F22 and E36)

The set of instructions for the production of the ballet ‘Rite of spring’, as choreographed by Pina Bausch in Wuppertal in 1975 (F25) R14 incorporates the musical score of Igor Stravinsky’s musical work ‘Rite of spring’ (F22)

This property associates the first conception of a work and the work itself that ensued from a given initial idea.

It is usually not recorded in cataloguing practice as it is only exceptionally documented in real life but is required in this semantic model as it marks the origin of the causality chain that results in a work’s coming into existence.

Examples:
The creative spark that motivated Richard Wagner, during a stormy sea crossing in July/August 1839, to compose an opera (F27) R16 initiated Richard Wagner’s opera entitled ‘Der fliegende Holländer’ (F15)

The creative spark that motivated Oscar Wilde, by May 1897, to write a poem inspired by his stay in the Reading prison in 1895-1897 (F27) R16 initiated Oscar Wilde’s poem entitled ‘The ballad of the Reading gaol’ (F15)

This property associates an instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression with an instance of F1 Work.

This property expresses the association that exists between an expression (F22) and the work that this expression conveys. The semantics of the association will be different depending on what specific subtype of F1 Work the work is an instance of. If the work is an instance of F14 Individual Work, the F22 Self-Contained Expression completely conveys the individual work. If the work is an instance of F15 Complex work, the F22 Self-Contained Expression conveys an alternative member of the complex work.

Our factual knowledge of how a given work is realised into an expression is often limited and this property makes it possible to express the association between instances of F22 Self-Contained Expression and the work it conveys without using the more developed paths.

Examples:
Dante’s work entitled ‘Inferno’ (F15) R3 is realised in The Italian text of Dante’s ‘Inferno’ as found in the authoritative critical edition La Commedia secondo l’antica vulgata a cura di Giorgio Petrocchi, Milano: Mondadori, 1966-67 (= Le Opere di Dante Alighieri, Edizione Nazionale a cura della Società Dantesca Italiana, VII, 1-4) (F22)

This property identifies an instance of F2 Expression that has been chosen as the most characteristic expression of the instance of F1 Work of which it is an expression.
Typically, any expression that is not regarded as “representative” for the work it expresses, would require a uniform title, with qualifiers specifying the differences between that expression and a representative expression, although this may not always be done in practice. The title of a Work may not be one taken from a representative expression.
A given work can have more than one representative expression, provided the differences between these expressions are not deemed “substantial.” If the anticipated needs of users are not considered to call for bibliographic distinctions between variant expressions of a work, then even expressions that differ significantly from each other can be regarded as equally representative for the work. (See FRBR: Final Report, p. 19-20).
A given expression can be deemed representative for a work with regard to some of its aspects (e.g., the text contained in an edition the title proper of which reads ‘The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke’, and the language of that text), and not representative for it with regard to some other aspects (e.g., the title proper ‘The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke’ itself, which, being different from the title that is regarded as “representative” for Shakespeare’s work, will require the use of a uniform title).
R40 has representative expression is a shortcut of the more developed path F1 Work R50B was assigned by F42 Representative Expression Assignment R51 assigned F2 Expression.

Examples:
Walt Whitman’s textual work titled ‘Leaves of Grass’ (F15) R40 has representative expression the linguistic, English content of the 1892 edition, known as the deathbed edition, of Walt Whitman’s textual work titled ‘Leaves of Grass’ (F2)

Beethoven’s 5th symphony (F15) R40 has representative expression the notational content of the 1809 edition of Beethoven’s 5th symphony (F2)

Beethoven’s 5th symphony (F15) R40 has representative expression the sonic content of the recorded performance of Beethoven’s 5th symphony by the Berliner Philharmoniker conducted by Herbert von Karajan in Berlin in November 1982 (F2)

The series titled ‘Nancy Drew Mysteries’ (F18) R40 has representative expression The overall content provided by publisher named ‘Armada’ in one volume belonging to that series, including, among other elements, the series title page, which states that the title of the series reads ‘Nancy Drew Mysteries’ (F24)

The periodical titled ‘The New Courier’, released by UNESCO, and described by the National Library of France in a bibliographic record that contains the following statement: “Notice réd. d’après le n° d’octobre 2002” (i.e., “description based on the issue dated October 2002”) (F18) R40 has representative expression The overall content of the October 2002 issue of UNESCO’s periodical titled ‘The New Courier’ (F24)

This property associates a bibliographic agency (represented by one or more of its cataloguers) and the assigning of which Manifestation (i.e., which instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type or F4 Manifestation Singleton) is representative for a given expression.
In cataloguing practice, such a relationship is usually just implicit. However, it can become explicit, for example when a bibliographic agency creates an authority record for a given work and fills the “Source” field with information about the publication that contains the expression that was used by the bibliographic agency to establish the uniform title for the work realised in that expression.

This property associates a bibliographic agency (represented by one or more of its cataloguers) and the assigning of which expression is representative for a given Work.
In cataloguing practice, such a relationship is usually just implicit. However, it can become explicit, for example when a bibliographic agency creates an authority record for a given work and fills the “Source” field with information about the publication that contains the expression that was used by the bibliographic agency to establish the uniform title for the work realised in that expression.

Examples:
Assigning the musical text contained in the manuscript identified by shelfmark ‘MS-8282’ within the collections of the National Library of France, Department for Music, as representative for Stanislas Champein’s opera ‘Vichnou’ (F41) R44 carried out by The National Library of France, identified by code ‘FRBNF’ at the beginning of field 001 in the INTERMARC authority record for the author/title heading for Stanislas Champein’s opera ‘Vichnou’ (F44)

The assignment of the Sanskrit text contained in the book that was published in 1973 under the title ‘Pāṇinīyaṃ Sabdānuśāsanam’ as being a representative instance of F2 Expression for the textual work of Pānini titled ‘Astādhyāyī’ (F42) R44 carried out by The bibliographic agency identified, in field 040 of a MARC21 authority record for the author/title heading ‘Pānini.

This property associates a publication, i.e. an instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type, with an instance of E60 Number, which denotes the number of physical units all exemplars of that publication should consist of, as long as they are recognised as complete exemplars of that publication. Typically, this property is observed on one exemplar of a publication, and extrapolated to all other exemplars of the same publication. This logical inference is an induction along the path that can be modelled as: F3 Manifestation Product Type R7B has example F5 Item P57has number of parts E60 Number.

It can happen that a given exemplar, or subset of exemplars, originally produced, or intended to be produced, with that characteristic, accidentally lacks it. This fact should be recorded as a property of F5 Item, and not of F3 Manifestation Product Type.

Examples:
The jigsaw puzzle entitled ‘Map of the New York city subway system’, designed by Stephen J. Voorhies and released around 1954 by the Union Dimes Savings Bank (F3) CLP57 should have number of parts 76 (E60) [Number of physical units of the exemplar held by the Library of Congress, as observed by a cataloguer from the Library of Congress when he/she catalogued that particular exemplar and recorded the statement: ‘1 jigsaw puzzle (ca. 76 pieces)’]

The publication entitled ‘History of costume: in slides, notes, and commentaries’ by Jeanne Button, Patricia Quinn Stuart, and Stephen Sbarge, released by Slide Presentations (New York) ca. 1975 (F3) CLP57 should have number of parts 1,491 (E60) [Number of physical units of the exemplar held by the Gelman Library of the George Washington University, as observed by a cataloguer from the Gelman Library of the George Washington University when he/she catalogued that particular exemplar and recorded the statement: ‘1,491 slides in 14 slide trays + 6 ring binders in cases (30 x 29 cm.)’]

This class comprises strings or codes assigned to instances of E1 CRM Entity in order to identify them uniquely and permanently within the context of one or more organisations. Such codes are often known as inventory numbers, registration codes, etc. and are typically composed of alphanumeric sequences. The class E42 Identifier is not normally used for machine-generated identifiers used for automated processing unless these are also used by human agents. [Adapted from the Scope Note of CIDOC CRM E42 Identifier ver. 5.0.1]

F13 Identifier covers the notion of “controlled access points” in library practice – both preferred forms and cross references. A cross reference may not identify uniquely an entity, but can be shared by two entities; however, as it displays the same structural characteristics as preferred controlled access points, it is still regarded in the model as an instance of F13 Identifier.

This class comprises works that are realised by one and only one self-contained expression, i.e., works representing the concept as expressed by precisely this expression, and that do not have other works as parts.

Inherent to the notion of work is the completion of recognisable outcomes of the work. These outcomes, i.e. the Self-Contained Expressions, are regarded as the symbolic equivalents of Individual Works, which form the atoms of a complex work. Normally creators would characterise an outcome of a work as finished. In other cases, one could recognise an outcome of a work as complete from the elaboration or logical coherence of its content, or if there is any historical knowledge about the creator deliberately or accidentally never finishing (completing) that particular expression. In all those cases, one would regard the corresponding expression as equivalent to one Individual Work.

Examples:
Abstract content of Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s ‘Carcere XVI: the pier with chains: 1st state’

Abstract content of Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s ‘Carcere XVI: the pier with chains: 2nd state’ [explanation: these are two states of the same etching, but with so many and so significant differences between them that they can scarcely be recognised as conveying the same work; more generally speaking, each individual state of an etching, as a Self-Contained Expression, conveys its own F14 Individual Work (even if the differences are not so blatant as in the case of ‘Carcere XVI’), and is regarded as part of the larger, abstract F15 Complex Work that encompasses all distinct states of the same etching]

Abstract content of the recording made of performances of Johann Sebastian Bach’s ‘Toccata in C minor BWV 911’ by Glenn Gould on May 15 &amp; 16, 1979, in Toronto, Eaton’s Auditorium

This class comprises works that have more than one work as members.

The members of a Complex Work may constitute components of the overall concept or be alternatives to other members of the work. In practice, no clear line can be drawn between parallel and subsequent processes in the evolution of a work. One part may not be finished when another is already revised. An initially monolithic work may be taken up and evolve in pieces. The member relationship of Work is based on the conceptual relationship, and should not be confused with the internal structural parts of an individual expression. The fact that an expression may contain parts from other work(s) does not make the expressed work complex. For instance, an anthology for which only one version exists is not a complex work.

The boundaries of a Complex Work have nothing to do with the value of the intellectual achievement but only with the dominance of a concept. Thus, derivations such as translations are regarded as belonging to the same Complex Work, even though in addition they constitute an Individual Work themselves. In contrast, a Work that significantly takes up and merges concepts of other works so that it is no longer dominated by the initial concept is regarded as a new work. In cataloguing practice, detailed rules are established prescribing which kinds of derivation should be regarded as crossing the boundaries of a complex work. Adaptation and derivation graphs allow the recognition of distinct sub-units, i.e. a complex work contained in a larger complex work.

As a Complex Work can be taken up by any creator who acquires the spirit of its concept, it is never finished in an absolute sense.
Examples:
Work entitled ‘La Porte de l’Enfer’ by Auguste Rodin

Work entitled ‘Hamlet’ by William Shakespeare

Work entitled ‘Der Ring der Nibelungen’ by Richard Wagner

Work entitled ‘Carceri d’invenzione’ by Giovanni Battista Piranesi

Work entitled ‘Mass in B minor BWV 232’ by Johann Sebastian Bach

This class comprises works whose essence is to enhance or add value to expressions from one or more other works without altering them, by the selection, arrangement and/or addition of features of different form, such as layout to words, recitation and movement to texts, instrumentation to musical scores etc. This does not make the contents of the incorporated expressions part of the Container Work, but only part of the resulting expression. Container Work may include the addition of new, original parts to the incorporated expressions, such as introductions, graphics, etc.

A new version of a container work does not make the resulting complex work a Container Work as well. The inclusion of expressions from a complex work in a Container Work does not make the Container Work itself complex.

Examples:
The aggregation and arrangement concept of the anthology entitled ‘American Women Poets of the Nineteenth Century: An Anthology’, edited by Cheryl Walker and published by Rutgers University Press in July 1992 [an F17 Aggregation Work]

The concept for the layout created by printer Guido Morris for the text of Michael Hamburger’s English translation of 12 poems by Georg Trakl for publication in 1952 [an F19 Publication Work]

The concept by the publisher named ‘Dell’ of issuing together, in 2002, three novels entitled ‘The Partner’, ‘The Street Lawyer’, and ‘A time to kill’, by the author named ‘John Grisham’, with just the statement ‘Three #1 bestsellers by John Grisham’ as a collective title [an F19 Publication Work]

The concept of Sergei Radlov’s mise-en-scène of a Yiddish translation of the textual work entitled ‘King Lear’ in Moscow in 1935 [an F20 Performance Work]

The concept of putting together the English text of ‘King Lear’ and a Spanish translation thereof in a bilingual edition of ‘King Lear’ [an F17 Aggregation Work]

This class comprises works whose essence is the selection and/or arrangement of expressions of one or more other works. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only part of the resulting expression. F17 Aggregation Work may include additional original parts.

An expression of a work may include expressions of other works within it. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process.

A new version of an aggregate work does not make the resulting complex work an aggregate work as well. The inclusion of expressions from a complex work in an aggregation work does not make the aggregation work itself complex.

Examples:
The aggregation and arrangement concept of the anthology entitled ‘American Women Poets of the Nineteenth Century: An Anthology’, edited by Cheryl Walker and published by Rutgers University Press in July 1992

The aggregation and arrangement concept of the Web site named ‘IFLANET’

The aggregation and arrangement concept of the collection of articles entitled ‘Marij Kogoj (1892-1992): zbornik referatov s kolokvija ob stoletnici skladateljevega rojstva 7.10.1992 v Ljubljani = Marij Kogoj (1892-1992): proceedings from the colloquium held in Ljubljana at the centenary of the composer’s birth on October 7th, 1992’ and edited by a person named ‘Ivan Klemenčič’

This class comprises works that are, or have been, planned to result in sequences of manifestations with common features. Whereas a work can acquire new members over the time it evolves Expressions and Manifestations are identified with a certain state achieved at a particular point in time. Therefore there is in general no single expression or manifestation representing a complete serial work, unless the serial work is ended.

Serial Works may or may not have a plan for an overall expression.

The retrospective reprinting of all issues of a Serial Work at once, in the form of a monograph, is regarded to be another member of a Complex Work, which contains the Serial Work and the Individual Work realised in the monograph. This does not make the monograph part of the Serial Work.

Examples:
The periodical entitled ‘The UNESCO Courier’, ISSN ‘0041-5278’

The periodical entitled ‘Courrier de l’UNESCO’, ISSN ‘0304-3118’ [French edition of the periodical titled ‘The UNESCO Courier’, ISSN ‘0041-5278’]

The series entitled ‘L’évolution de l’humanité’, ISSN ‘0755-1843’ [a monograph series comprising volumes that were published from 1920 on, and some of which were reprinted, with different physical features and rearranged in a different order, from 1968 on, in a distinct series also entitled ‘L’évolution de l’humanité’, ISSN ‘0755-1770’]

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises the sums of concepts which appear in the course of the coherent evolution of an original idea into one or more expressions that are dominated by the original idea. The substance of Work is concepts. A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously or over time. A Work may have members that constitute components of the overall concept or that are alternatives to other members of the work. Members of a work may or may not represent the concept of the Work as a whole; for instance a translation reinterprets the whole, a volume of a trilogy represents a part of the concept.

A Work can be either individual or complex. If it is individual its concept is completely realised in a single F22 Self-Contained Expression. If it is complex its concept is embedded in an F15 Complex Work. An F15 Complex Work consists of members that are either F15 Complex Works themselves or F14 Individual Works. The member relationship of Work is based on the members respecting the same concept, and should not be confused with the structural parts of an expression, that might be taken from other work(s).

A Work is the product of an intellectual process of one or more persons, yet only indirect evidence about it is at our hands. This can be contextual information such as the existence of an order for a work, reflections of the creators themselves that are documented somewhere, and finally the expressions of the work created. As ideas normally take shape during discussion, elaboration and implementation, it is not reasonable to assume that a work starts with a complete concept. Moreover, it can be very difficult or impossible to define the whole of the concept of a work at some given time. The only objective evidence for such a notion can be based on a stage of expressions at a given time. In this sense, self-contained expressions serve as a kind of “snap-shots” of a work.

A Work may aggregate expressions of other works into a new expression. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression.

Examples:
Abstract content of Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s ‘Carcere XVI: the pier with chains: 1st state’ (F14)

‘La Porte de l’Enfer’ by Auguste Rodin conceived between 1880 and 1917 (F15)

‘Hamlet’ by William Shakespeare (F15)

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises the sets of concepts for rendering a particular or a series of like performances.

F20 Performance Work is declared as a subclass of F16 Container Work. This implies that the incorporated expressions (such as the text of the staged play, the text of the argument for the ballet, the recorded music to be used for the ballet, or the content of the musical score to be used for a concert, etc.) are not by themselves a part of the expression of this F1 Work. Rather, an expression (F25 Performance Plan) of the instructions the stage production, choreography or musical performance consists of incorporates (R14) that textual or musical content. In other words, the text of ‘Hamlet’ is not a component of the concepts that underlie a given mise-en-scène of ‘Hamlet’, but any staging directions (F25 Performance Plan) that convey a given director’s vision of ‘Hamlet’ must necessarily incorporate the text of ‘Hamlet’.

Examples:
The conceptual content of Sergei Radlov’s mise-en-scène of a Yiddish translation of the textual work entitled ‘King Lear’ in Moscow in 1935

The conceptual content of Pina Bausch’s choreography of the ballet entitled ‘Rite of spring’ in Wuppertal in 1975

The conceptual content of Bruno Walter’s performance of Gustav Mahler’s 9th symphony in 1961

The conceptual content of the “performance handbook” for Luigi Nono’s musical work entitled ‘À Pierre’

This class comprises works that conceptualise the capturing of features of perdurants. The characteristics of the manifestation of a recording work are those of the product of the capture process. The characteristics of any other works recorded are distinct from those of the recording work itself. In the case where the recorded perdurant expresses some Work, the respective instance of F21 is also an F16 Container Work

This class comprises the immaterial realisations of individual works at a particular time that are regarded as a complete whole. The quality of wholeness reflects the intention of its creator that this expression should convey the concept of the work. Such a whole can in turn be part of a larger whole.

Inherent to the notion of work is the completion of recognisable outcomes of the work. These outcomes, i.e. the Self-Contained Expressions, are regarded as the symbolic equivalents of Individual Works, which form the atoms of a complex work. A Self-Contained Expression may contain expressions or parts of expressions from other work, such as citations or items collected in anthologies. Even though they are incorporated in the Self-Contained Expression, they are not regarded as becoming members of the expressed container work by their inclusion in the expression, but are rather regarded as foreign or referred elements.

F22 Self-Contained Expression can be distinguished from F23 Expression Fragment in that an F23 Expression Fragment was not intended by its creator to make sense by itself. Normally creators would characterise an outcome of a work as finished. In other cases, one could recognise an outcome of a work as complete from the elaboration or logical coherence of its content, or if there is any historical knowledge about the creator deliberately or accidentally never finishing (completing) that particular expression. In all those cases, one would regard an expression as self-contained.

Examples:
The Italian text of Dante’s ‘Inferno’ as found in the authoritative critical edition La Commedia secondo l’antica vulgata a cura di Giorgio Petrocchi, Milano: Mondadori, 1966-67 (= Le Opere di Dante Alighieri, Edizione Nazionale a cura della Società Dantesca Italiana, VII, 1-4)

The musical notation of Franz Schubert’s lied known as ‘Ave Maria’

The musical notation of Franz Schubert’s lieder cycle entitled ‘Seven Songs after Walter Scott’s The Lady of the Lake’, of which ‘Ave Maria’ is a distinct part

This class comprises parts of Expressions and these parts are not Self-contained Expressions themselves.

The existence of an instance of F23 Expression Fragment can be due to accident, such as loss of material over time, e.g. the only remaining manuscript of an antique text being partially eaten by worms, or due to deliberate isolation, such as excerpts taken from a text by the compiler of a collection of excerpts.

An F23 Expression Fragment is only identified with respect to its occurrence in a known or assumed whole. The size of an instance of F23 Expression Fragment ranges from more than 99% of an instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression to tiny bits (a few words from a text, one bar from a musical composition, one detail from a still image, a two-second clip from a movie, etc.).

This class comprises complete sets of signs present in publications, reflecting publishers’ final decisions as to both content and layout of the publications.

Examples:
The text, its layout and the textual and graphic (Saur’s logo on p. [i]) content of front and back cover, spine (spine title), and p. [i-iv] of the publication entitled ‘Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records: final report’, published by K. G. Saur in 1998, identified by ISBN ‘3-598-11382-X’

The overall content of the book identified by ISBN ‘0-8014-9130-4’: the text of Stephen Crane’s complete poems as edited by Joseph Katz, the numbering system introduced by Joseph Katz in order to identify each individual poem by Stephen Crane, page numbers, the text of Joseph Katz’s dedication, preface, acknowledgements, and introduction, the table of contents, the index of first lines, the statements found on title page, back of title page (including CIP bibliographic record), cover front, back front, and spine, and the layout of the publication; for one of Stephen Crane’s longer poems, printed on p. 142-143, a statement reads at bottom of p. 142: ‘[NO STANZA BREAK]’: obviously, this statement does not belong to the Self-Contained Expression intended by Stephen Crane, and presumably not to the one intended by editor Joseph Katz either, but was more probably added by the publishing team, due to characteristics of the layout of the publication: a cautious reader can easily interpret ‘[NO STANZA BREAK]’ as non-belonging to the poem itself, but an OCR process would not make the distinction between the text of the poem and the statement made by the publisher; ‘[NO STANZA BREAK]’ belongs to the Publication Expression, although it does not belong to the Self-Contained Expression intended by Stephen Crane and Joseph Katz

The overall content of the LP sound recording identified by label and label number ‘CBS 34-61237’: a recorded performance of Terry Riley’s musical work ‘In C’, the text of liner notes by Paul Williams translated into French by Bernard Weinberg, technical statements such as ‘Stereo,’ publisher’s logo, series logo, title and statement of responsibility on front, back, and spine of the cover and on the recording itself, duration statement, cover art by G. Joly, overall layout, etc.; a special, shunting sound was added at the end of side one and beginning of side two, as Terry Riley’s work is in the form of a continuous musical flow without any interruption and the technical possibilities of vinyl LPs did not allow the complete performance to be contained on just one side: that special, shunting sound was not intended in Riley’s score nor in the performance but was added by the publisher (with or without Riley’s consent, this detail is not documented), and as such it is part of the Publication Expression although it is not part of the composer’s and the performers’ Self-Contained Expression (this shunting sound was no longer needed in subsequent releases on CD)

The overall content of the DVD entitled ‘The Aviator (2-Disc Full Screen Edition)’, released in 2004: Martin Scorsese’s movie itself; layout of the box and the two DVDs contained in the box; pictures on the DVDs themselves; English, Spanish, and French subtitles; English and French audio tracks; and bonuses: commentaries by director Martin Scorsese, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and producer Michael Mann; a deleted scene (‘Howard Tells Ava About His Car Accident’); and featurettes ‘A Life Without Limits: The Making of The Aviator’; ‘The Role of Howard Hughes in Aviation History’; ‘Modern Marvels: Howard Hughes, A Documentary by the History Channel’; ‘The Visual Effects of The Aviator’; ‘The Affliction of Howard Hughes: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder’; ‘The Age of Glamour: The Hair And Makeup of The Aviator’; ‘Costuming The Aviator: The Work of Sandy Powell’; ‘Constructing The Aviator: The Work of Dante Ferretti’; ‘An evening with Leonardo DiCaprio and Alan Alda’; ‘OCD Panel Discussion With Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese, and Howard Hughes’ Widow Terry Moore’; ‘Still Gallery’; ‘Scoring The Aviator: The Work Of Howard Shore’; and ‘The Wainwright Family – Loudon, Rufus and Martha’

This class comprises sets of directions to which individual performances of theatrical, choreographic, or musical works and their combinations should conform.

In the case of theatrical performances, such directions incorporate, but are not limited nor reducible to, the text of a given version of the play performed (e.g., a translated text, some passages of which are deliberately omitted, with some rephrased lines, etc.).

In the case of choreographic performances, such directions may incorporate, but are neither limited nor reducible to, the notation of choreographic movements in systems such as labanotation.

In the case of musical performances, such directions may incorporate, but are neither limited nor reducible to, the musical score. In case of electronic music, they may incorporate software instructions.

These directions may or may not completely determine the form of the intended performance. Depending on the nature of the directions, the form of the intended performance, such as the sets of movements or the sound characteristics, may or may not be predictable from the directions.

Note that a performance plan may be more or less elaborate, and may even foresee just improvisation.

Examples:			
The set of instructions for the production of a Yiddish translation of the textual work entitled ‘King Lear’, as directed by Sergei Radlov in Moscow in 1935

The set of instructions for the production of the ballet entitled ‘Rite of spring’, as choreographed by Pina Bausch in Wuppertal in 1975

The set of instructions by Bruno Walter for performing Gustav Mahler’s 9th symphony, delivered by him to the Columbia Symphony Orchestra during rehearsals in Hollywood in 1961 (as partially documented in the CD entitled ‘Bruno Walter conducts and talks about Mahler symphony No. 9: rehearsal &amp; performance’)

This class comprises the births of original ideas. It marks the initiation of the creation of a work. This class should be used where there is historical evidence of the initiation before the appearance of physical evidence for the F1 Work. This does not always correlate with the date assigned in common library practice to the work; which is usually a later event.

Richard Wagner’s having the initial idea of composing the opera entitled ‘Der fliegende Holländer’ during a stormy sea crossing in July/August 1839

Oscar Wilde’s having by May 1897 the initial idea of writing his poem entitled ‘The ballad of the Reading gaol’, inspired by his stay in the Reading prison from November 20, 1895 to May 18, 1897, and the execution of Charles Thomas Woolridge on July 7, 1896

This class comprises activities that result in instances of F2 Expression coming into existence. This class characterises the externalisation of an Individual Work.

Although F2 Expression is an abstract entity, a conceptual object, the creation of an expression inevitably also affects the physical world: when you scribble the first draft of a poem on a sheet of paper, you produce an F4 Manifestation Singleton; F28 Expression Creation is a subclass of E12 Production because the recording of the expression causes a physical modification of the carrying E18 Physical Thing. The work becomes manifest by being expressed on a physical carrier different from the creator’s mind. The spatio-temporal circumstances under which the expression is created are necessarily the same spatio-temporal circumstances under which the first F4 Manifestation Singleton is produced. The mechanisms through which oral tradition (of myths, tales, music, etc.) operates are not further investigated in this model. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only those instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s mind and the auditor’s mind are taken into account (for a discussion of the modelling of oral traditions, see: Nicolas, Yann. ‘Folklore Requirements for Bibliographic Records: oral traditions and FRBR.’ In: Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly (2005). Vol. 39, No. 3-4. P. 179-195).

Examples:
The creation of the original manuscript score of ‘Uwertura tragiczna’ by Andrzej Panufnik in 1942 in Warsaw

The reconstruction from memory of the manuscript score of ‘Uwertura tragiczna’ by Andrzej Panufnik in 1945 after the original score was destroyed during the war

The recording of the third alternate take of ‘Blue Hawaii’ performed by Elvis Presley in Hollywood, Calif., Radio Recorders, on March 22nd, 1961 [each individual take is a distinct instance of F2 Expression]

This class comprises the intellectual or artistic realisations of works in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as texts, poems, jokes, musical or choreographic notations, movement pattern, sound pattern, images, multimedia objects, or any combination of such forms that have objectively recognisable structures. The substance of F2 Expression is signs.

Expressions cannot exist without a physical carrier, but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. Carriers may include human memory.

Inasmuch as the form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression, any change in form (e.g., from alpha-numeric notation to spoken word, a poem created in capitals and rendered in lower case) is a new F2 Expression. Similarly, changes in the intellectual conventions or instruments that are employed to express a work (e.g., translation from one language to another) result in the creation of a new F2 Expression. Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the resulting F2 Expression is considered to be a new F2 Expression. Minor changes, such as corrections of spelling and punctuation, etc., are normally considered variations within the same F2 Expression. On a practical level, the degree to which distinctions are made between variant expressions of a work will depend to some extent on the nature of the F1 Work itself, and on the anticipated needs of users.

The genre of the work may provide an indication of which features are essential to the expression. In some cases, aspects of physical form, such as typeface and page layout, are not integral to the intellectual or artistic realisation of the work as such, and therefore are not distinctive criteria for the respective expressions. For another work features such as layout may be essential. For instance, the author or a graphic designer may wrap a poem around an image.

An expression of a work may include expressions of other works within it. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression.

If an instance of F2 Expression is of a specific form, such as text, image, etc., it may be simultaneously instantiated in the specific classes representing these forms in CIDOC CRM. Thereby one can make use of the more specific properties of these classes, such as language (which is applicable to linguistic objects only).

Examples:
The Italian text of Dante’s ‘Divina Commedia’ as found in the authoritative critical edition ‘La Commedia secondo l’antica vulgata a cura di Giorgio Petrocchi’, Milano: Mondadori, 1966-67 (= Le Opere di Dante Alighieri, Edizione Nazionale a cura della Società Dantesca Italiana, VII, 1-4) (F22)

The Italian text of Dante’s ‘Inferno’ as found in the same edition (F22)

Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita	
mi ritrovai per una selva oscura	
ché la diritta via era smarrita [the Italian text of the first stanza of Dante’s ‘Inferno’ and ‘Divina Commedia’] (F23)

This class comprises the activities of publishing. Such an event includes the creation of an F24 Publication Expression and setting up the means of production. The end of this event is regarded as the date of publication, regardless of whether the carrier production is started. Publishing can be either physical or electronic. Electronic publishing is regarded as making an instance of F24 Publication Expression available in electronic form on a public network. Electronic Publishing does not mean producing a physical F5 Item by partially electronic means. Making an electronic file available on a physical carrier can be regarded as equivalent to setting up the means of production; downloading the file is regarded as the electronic equivalent of F32 Carrier Production Event.

Examples:
Publishing Amerigo Vespucci’s ‘Mundus novus’ in Paris ca. 1503-1504

Establishing in 1972 the layout, features, and prototype for the publication of ‘The complete poems of Stephen Crane, edited with an introduction by Joseph Katz’ (ISBN ‘0-8014-9130-4’), which served for a second print run in 1978

This class comprises activities that follow the directions of a performance plan, such as a theatrical play, an expression of a choreographic work or a musical work; i.e., they are intended to communicate directly or indirectly to an audience.

Such activities can be identified at various levels of granularity, and can be contiguous or not. Any individual performance (with or without intermissions) is a single instance of F31 Performance. In addition, a complete run of performances can also be seen as an instance of F31 Performance, with individual performances as parts. A complete run of performances may comprise an original run plus any of its extensions and tours.

Note that a performance plan may be more or less elaborate, and may even foresee just improvisation.

Examples:
Performing the first performance of a Yiddish translation of the textual work entitled ‘King Lear’, as directed by Sergei Radlov, in Moscow, at the Moscow State Jewish Theatre, on February 10, 1935 [individual performance]

Performing the ballet entitled ‘Rite of spring’, as choreographed by Pina Bausch, in Avignon, at the Popes’ Palace, on July 7, 1995 [individual performance]

This class comprises activities that result in instances of F5 Item coming into existence. The creation of a new copy of a file on an electronic carrier is also regarded as a Carrier Production Event.

Typically, the production of copies of a publication (no matter whether it is a book, a sound recording, a DVD, a cartographic resource, etc.) strives to produce items all as similar as possible to a prototype that displays all the features that all the copies of the publication should also display, which is reflected in property R27 used as source material F24 Publication Expression.

The printing of copies of the 3rd edition of ‘Codex Manesse: die Miniaturen der großen Heidelberger Liederhandschrift, herausgegeben und erläutert von Ingo F. Walther unter Mitarbeit von Gisela Siebert’, Insel-Verlag, 1988 [a fac-simile edition of an illuminated mediaeval manuscript]

This class comprises activities that consist in making copies, more or less mechanically, of an instance of E84 Information Carrier (such as an F5 Item or an F4 Manifestation Singleton which is also instance of E84 Information Carrier), preserving the expression carried by it. A Reproduction Event results in new instances of E84 Information Carrier coming into existence. In general, the copy will have different attributes from the original and they are therefore not regarded as siblings.

This class makes it possible to account for the legal distinction between private copying for the purpose of “fair use,” and mass production for the purpose of dissemination.

It can prove difficult to determine where to draw the line between F33 Reproduction Event and F32 Carrier Production Event in cases where multiple copies are produced. In this case, the copies, but not the original, may be regarded as instances of F5 Item. It is the existence of an explicit production plan that makes the difference. As a consequence, F33 Reproduction Event and F32 Carrier Production Event are not declared as disjoint, which makes it possible to account for such situations that could be regarded as instances of both Production Event and Reproduction Event.

This class comprises the definitions of publication products.

An instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type is the “species”, and all copies of a given object are “specimens” of it. An instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type defines all of the features or traits that instances of F5 Item normally display in order that they may be recognised as copies of a particular publication. However, due to production problems or subsequent events, one or more instances of F5 Item may not exhibit all these features or traits; yet such instances still retain their relationship to the same instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type.

The features that characterise a given instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type include: one instance of F24 Publication Expression, containing one or more than one instance of F2 Expression, reflecting the authors’ content of the manifestation and all additional input by the publisher; and the appropriate types of physical features for that form of the object. For example, hardcover and paperback are two distinct publications (i.e. two distinct instances of F3 Manifestation Product Type) even though authorial and editorial content are otherwise identical in both publications. The activity of cataloguing aims at the most accurate listing of features or traits of an instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type that are sufficient to distinguish it from another instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type. In this sense, it may be said that a typical bibliographic record for a publication (not a manuscript) reflects the notion of F3 Manifestation Product Type.

Examples:
The publication product containing the text entitled ‘Harmonie universelle’ (authored by the person named ‘Marin Mersenne’), issued in 1636 in Paris by the publisher named ‘Sébastien Cramoisy’

The publication product containing a modern reprint of Marin Mersenne’s ‘Harmonie universelle’, issued in 1986 in Paris by the publisher named ‘Les éditions du CNRS’, and identified by ISBN ‘2-222-00835-2’

This class comprises activities through which an Agency declares (implicitly or explicitly) that a given instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type or F4 Manifestation Singleton is representative for a given F2 Expression, i.e., that some features found on that instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type or F4 Manifestation Singleton (most prominently, information about the title) can be inferred to also apply to that instance of F2 Expression, no matter within which manifestation it is embodied.
The reasoning behind is that the Work title is known through the title of an Expression that is deemed representative of the Work, and the title of the representative Expression is known through the title proper of a Manifestation that is deemed representative of the Expression representative of the Work.

Examples:

By using the title proper ‘Mrs Dalloway’ found on the first edition of a novel by Virginia Woolf as the basis for a uniform title for that novel, rather than the title proper ‘The hours’ found on the manuscripts held by the British Library, an Agency implicitly states that the printed edition (instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type) is representative for the instance of F2 Expression that is representative for the F1 Work, whereas the hand-written instances of F4 Manifestation Singleton are not

By not using the title proper ‘The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke’ found on an instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type as the basis for a uniform title heading for a work by Shakespeare, an Agency explicitly states that that instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type is not representative (at least, as far as title information is concerned) for an F2 Expression of Shakespeare’s F1 Work ‘Hamlet’

Selecting the manuscript identified by shelfmark ‘MS-8282’ within the collections of the National Library of France, Department for Music, as representative for the musical text of Stanislas Champein’s opera ‘Vichnou’ [explanation: the BnF’s Department for Music holds 3 manuscript scores (identified by shelfmarks ‘MS-8282’, ‘MS-13778’, and ‘MS-17321’) for this opera; the title inscribed on MS-8282 is ‘Vichnou’, while MS-13778 and MS-17321 are entitled ‘Vistnou’; the authorised form chosen by cataloguers and reference tools such as the Grove Dictionary for Opera is ‘Vichnou’, while ‘Vistnou’ is recorded in the BnF’s authority file only as a cross reference]

This class comprises activities through which an Agency declares (implicitly or explicitly) that a given instance of F2 Expression is representative for a given F15 Complex Work, i.e., that some attributes of that instance of F2 Expression (most prominently, information about the title) can be inferred to also apply to that instance of F15 Complex Work, no matter in which particular expression it is realised.
The reasoning behind this is that the Work title is known through the title of an Expression that is deemed representative of the Work, and the title of the representative Expression is known through the title of a Manifestation that is deemed representative of the Expression that is representative of the Work.
For instance, by using the qualified uniform title ‘Poe, Edgar Allan, 1809-1849. Murders in the rue Morgue (French)’ for the French rendition of Poe’s ‘Murders in the rue Morgue’ by Baudelaire, an Agency implicitly states that the French text does not constitute a representative F2 Expression for Poe’s F1 Work, however the original English text does constitute a representative F2 Expression for Poe’s F1 Work.

Examples:
Choosing the English text entitled ‘Murders in the rue Morgue’, with that particular formulation of its title, as representative for the complex work Edgar Allan Poe’s ‘Murders in the rue Morgue’

This class comprises agents who create the bibliographic description of publications and perform the authority control associated with such descriptions, for the description of copies of such publications actually held by libraries, and for the description of unique documents (manuscripts, objects…) held by libraries.
The activity of creating such descriptions implies that one has to make decisions (as to the uniform title for a work, as to whether an arrangement still belongs to the same work or is definitely a new work, etc.). Since such decisions always are debatable and different agencies can make different decisions about the same real-world entities, it is important to document which agency made which decision.

This class comprises physical objects that each carry an instance of F2 Expression, and that were produced as unique objects, with no siblings intended in the course of their production. It should be noted that if all but one copy of a given publication are destroyed, then that copy does not become an instance of F4 Manifestation Singleton, because it was produced together with sibling copies, even though it now happens to be unique. Examples of instances of F4 Manifestation Singleton include manuscripts, preparatory sketches and the final clean draft sent by an author or a composer to a publisher.

Examples:
The manuscript known as ‘The Book of Kells’

The manuscript score of Charles Racquet’s ‘Organ fantasy’, included in Marin Mersenne’s personal copy of his own ‘Harmonie universelle’ [Marin Mersenne planned a second edition of his ‘Harmonie universelle’ after it had been first published in 1636, and he asked the composer Charles Racquet to compose his organ fantasy especially for that planned second edition; but Mersenne died before he could finish and publish the second edition and Racquet’s score remained until the 20th century as a manuscript addition to Mersenne’s copy, held in Paris by the Library of the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]

Marin Mersenne’s personal copy, held in Paris by the Library of the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers, of his own ‘Harmonie universelle’, containing all of his manuscript additions for a planned second edition that never took place before his death, but that served as a basis for the modern reprint published in 1986

An abstract notion or idea. [FRBRER] Includes fields of knowledge, disciplines, schools of thought, etc. Includes philosophies, religions, political ideologies, etc. Includes theories, processes, techniques, practices, etc. [Definition from the FRAD draft model, unchanged]

This class comprises non-material products of our minds and other human produced data that have become objects of a discourse about their identity, circumstances of creation or historical implication. The production of such information may have been supported by the use of technical devices such as cameras or computers.

Characteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or thought by someone, and then may be documented or communicated between persons. Instances of E28 Conceptual Object have the ability to exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper, electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human memories, etc.

They cannot be destroyed. They exist as long as they can be found on at least one carrier or in at least one human memory. Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are lost. [Scope note for E28 Conceptual Object in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space.

It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatio-temporal bounds. These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture.

Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the ‘Neolithic Period’, the ‘Ming Dynasty’ or the ‘McCarthy Era’. There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.

There are two different conceptualisations of “artistic style”, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, ‘Impressionism’ can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.

Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.

[This is the Scope note for E4 Period in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]

[Note that in CIDOC CRM, E12 Production, E13 Attribute Assignment, and E65 Creation are indirect subclasses of E4 Period = F8 Event; as a consequence, F8 Event is an indirect superclass of: F27 Work Conception, F28 Expression Creation, F40 Identifier Assignment, F41 Representative Manifestation Assignment, F42 Representative Expression Assignment, F32 Carrier Production Event, F33 Reproduction Event, and F30 Publication Event]

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Scope note:
This class comprises extents in space, in particular on the surface of the earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of immobile objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.

It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.

Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a section of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination. [Scope Note for E53 Place in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]

Note that Places may be determined by the location of historical or contemporary objects, geographic features, events or geo-political units.

Examples:
The area referred to as ‘Lutèce’
The area referred to as ‘verso of the title page of the Library of Congress’s copy of the 1st edition of the novel entitled ‘Da Vinci Code’
