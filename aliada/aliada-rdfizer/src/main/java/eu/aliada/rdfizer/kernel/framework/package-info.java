/**
 * Classes in this package (and sub packages) are ALIADA tool extension points.
 * If you want to extend ALIADA you should probably have a look in this package and 
 * provide your own implementation of core framework interfaces.
 * Here we also define some useful supertype layers that provide common expected behaviour, so 
 * it is strongly recommended to extend those classes instead of writing things from scratch.
